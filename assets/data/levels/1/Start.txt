hah!
Good job!
Ooookay, see the thing that keeps moving left and right?
Yeah, don't touch it.
That's what i like to call a "Lost Soul".
A sin, in your case.
Touching it results in the same ending as if you would touch a spike.
Soooo, no touching.
BUT
You CAN get rid of it!
If you bump into it while DASHING you just kill it!
Never to be seen again.
I'll go now.
Good luck! :D
