Alright
Alright so, you see those spikes yeah?
Don't bother trying to jump over to the other side. You WILL die.
But remember how i said a moment ago something about "DASHING"?
Well, to dash you have to first get a lil' momentum, then press SHIFT or Z to get launched into the direction you are facing.
In this case, you will have to face right, JUMP, and while in midair, press the DASH key you want. (SHIFT or Z)
Simple right?
Go ahead and try!
